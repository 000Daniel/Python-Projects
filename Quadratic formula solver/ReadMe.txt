This script can accept three(3) numbers to solve a quadratic formula with.

**Usage:**
  simply type in console: ```python3 Quadratic-Formula.py a b c```
  replace the 'a', 'b' and 'c' with your desired numbers.


This software was programmed on Visual Studio Code (Python3).
Note: This is my first Python script written!
