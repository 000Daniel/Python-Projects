# Python Projects Repository

Each folder holds a different project of mine.
Some folders might contain multiple versions of a project of mine. 
Feel free to look around and try some of those scripts for yourself.
<br />
<br />
### Note:  
   >Usually I write my Python scripts in Visual Studio Code with Python3  
   >My projects usually are coding exercises, issues are to be expected.  
   >Publish date - refers to the upload date of the project.  
   >Release date - refers to when was the project finished.
